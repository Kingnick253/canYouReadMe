## Description 
  This project is fully functional readme generator. This can be used for a multitude of projects to provide the user with a professional readme.md file. This solves the problem of having to think of what a professional readme looks like, and will reduced the amount of time spent at the beginning/end of the project trying create one from scratch. In this project I learned how to properly utilize a function to write a file and send it to a different folder.

After that if you dont already have node installed on  your computer, you want to install that. Onces that is done you will need to run the node command "npm i" to get all the  third party apps. From there you will run the the command "node index.js" then complete the prompts asked of you, and then you will have a professional readme.md file.
